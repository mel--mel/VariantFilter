# VariantFilter
Implementation of a custom filter, filtering out specific variants of a Variant Call Format (VCF) file, using C++. 

This basic filter reads a VCF file (like input.vcf given in this repository) and filters out all variants that do not comply to 
a certain condition. It then produces a new filtered VCF file.

The path to the input file, as long as the filtering condition, can be changed by modifying the main function 
according to the guidleines given in the source code comments.

Enjoy!
